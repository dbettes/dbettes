<h1 align="center">Hey there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I am a Software Developer gone Platform Engineer who enjoys improving the lives of dev teams.  I have spent much time learning how to create well-tested, reliable software and work to enable other developers to make smart choices and create great apps and services.  I enjoy teaching others, writing documentation, and a smooth software development lifecycle (SDLC).  When not working, I tinker with Christmas lights, 3D printing, game development, and smart home automation.
